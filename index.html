            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I was born in the Rotunda hospital, Dublin in 1999, I have spent all my life, however, <em>in the countryside</em>. As a kid
                I loved living in the countryside, I loved climbing trees and roaming around the forests in my area. This novelty started
                wearing off as I grew older; I started to become interested in technology and more specifically computers. With
                this I started to realise the down-side of the countryside: <strong> Terrible Wi-fi</strong>.At age 8 I recieved my first
                laptop, it was a <strong>Samsung RV511</strong>, I remember the model number as I spent well over a year researching the best
                specs for a budget.<br /><br />

                My interest in computers grew progressively as I grew older and began to understand more about them and how powerful
                they are. I knew since 4th year in secondary school that computer science would be my ideal course because of
                my interest. Thus, when the <strong>dreaded</strong> Leaving cert rolled around I decided to work really hard to get enough points
                for Computer Science. I joined a local study centre and following daily nights of studying hard for a year, I finally sat
                the Leaving Cert. It went well overwall and in particular I did well in my favourite subject, Maths.
                <br/><br />

                I am now in University College Cork studying Computer Science and I am really enjoying it. I chose this
                particular course because of the diversity in aspects of computer science it contains. There is a core
                programming module alongside other modules which cover different aspects of computing such as Databases and
                Hardware. My favourite module, however, is web development, I love learning how to create websites that both
                look nice and are user friendly.
